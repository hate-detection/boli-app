## Overview

BOLI is a `Next.js` app aimed towards the development of a frontend web-application for Machine Learning model inference.

This project is designed and developed as part of the Masters Thesis Submission for MSc Cyber Security from Royal Holloway, University of London.

BOLI provides two interfaces: `/predict` and `/feedback`. Users can utilise the `/predict` interface to access the Machine Learning model. Users can also provide feedback through the `/feedback` interface.

## Installation

>[!NOTE]
>
> You must have `node.js` installed on your system before proceeding with the below steps.

**Steps:**

1. Clone the repo and change directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hate-detection/boli-app.git
cd boli-app
```

2. Install dependencies with

```bash
npm install
```
3. Run the server in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Security Configuration

A major security configuration involves the Rotating Token Mechanism for the `/api/predict` and `/api/feedback` endpoints. Ideally, the `/api/feedback` endpoint can **_only_** be called after getting a successful response from `/api/predict`.

To implement this logic, the `/api/predict` endpoint sends a hashed value with a secret token, the text and the predicted values. The `/api/feedback` endpoint parses the incoming request for the hashed value and generates its own hash. If the incoming hash and the newly generated hash match, `/api/feedback` accepts the request. Moreover, one hashed value can only be used once.

The hash is computed using the following formula:
$$generateKey(length) = Secret_{token} \\
sha256(Secret_{token}\ +\ text\ +\ prediction) = Secret_{key}
$$

Here, $generateKey(length)$ is the function which generates a random 32-byte value every 30 minutes. The $Secret_{key}$ is the final hashed value computed with $Secret_{token}$ generated in the previous function, the $text$ entered by users and the $prediction$ generated by the ML Model.
